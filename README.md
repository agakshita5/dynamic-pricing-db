## 📊 Insights Uncovered

- High discounts ≠ high ratings — *delivery ease and how people feel* matter more.
- Top-selling items lacked comfort or fit feedback — especially in **Clothing & Accessories**.
- Products with “Try & Buy” or “Easy Returns” got better ratings — users value *flexibility*.
- “Best Offers” weren’t always cheapest — regular discounts sometimes beat them in final price after discount.
- Transparency & comfort issues showed up even in 4–5⭐ reviews — *ratings don’t tell the full story*.
